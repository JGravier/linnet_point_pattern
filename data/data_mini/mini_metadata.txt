This minimal dataset allows to create a linnet object. 
It contains four tables regarding political posters on public space.

The two following files are required to create a linear network.
mini_node.txt: coordinates of points required to create the planar network
mini_edge.txt: extremities (origin-destination) of non-directed edges of the planar network

The following file is required to create a planar point pattern. It regards political posters.
mini_points.txt: 
- x,y: coordinates of the political poster (the last one is out of the network)
- nb: integer attribute, number of political posters
- pol: character attribute, political tendency (fl, far-left; fe, feminist; fr, far-right)
- sti: boolean attribute, presence of stickers (0, no; 1, yes)
